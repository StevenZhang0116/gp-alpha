Group research with Zehua Yu (Fudan University, Columbia University) mentored by Jiayi Xie during my internship in [Egret Quant](https://www.egretquant.com/). Use genetic programming to automatically dig factors by crossover and mutation to the formula trees using daily price/volume data. Modify the source code of the [DEAP](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/) package to add more functionalities, including data APIs, analytic tools, units check, correlation restrictions with existing factors, etc. Add more out-of-sample tests, like the trapezoidal pattern of PNL curves, uniformity in different pools, and consistency under power tests, to improve the modelâ€™s robustness both in the short-term and long-term.
